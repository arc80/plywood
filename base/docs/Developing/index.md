When you develop a C++ project using Plywood, your source code is organized into [modules](KeyConcepts#modules) belonging to one or more [repos](KeyConcepts#repos). You can also add third-party libraries to your project from just about anywhere by writing [extern providers](KeyConcepts#extern-providers).

See the following subsections:

* [Creating New Repos](NewRepos)
* [Adding New Modules](NewModules)
* [Adding New Extern Providers](NewExternProviders)
