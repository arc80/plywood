<% title "HashMap Traits" %>

To instantiate a `HashMap`, you must specialize it by defining a traits class. The traits class must declare a specific set of member types and static member functions, some of which are required and some of which are optional. The traits class is then passed as the sole template argument to `HashMap`.
    
## Required Member Types

Every traits class must declare the following members:

<% member typename [strong Key] %>

The type of the key used during lookup. The `HashMap::find()` and `HashMap::insertOrFind()` functions expect arguments of this type.

It must be possible to hash `Key` objects; in other words, to convert any `Key` object to a 32-bit hash value in a well-distributed way.

<% member typename [strong Item] %>

The type that gets stored in the `HashMap` itself. The `HashMap` is basically a collection of `Item` objects. Given an `Item` object, it should be possible to determine if it matches a given `Key`.

<% member static bool [strong match](const Item&, const Key&) %>

Returns `true` if, for the purposes of this hash map, the given `Item` object matches the given `Key`. This function can also accept an optional third argument of type `Context`; see the "Using Contexts" section below.

<% endMembers %>

Here's an example of a traits class from the WebServer that maps `StringView` to `StringView`. This `HashMap` doesn't own any string memory; instead, all strings are assumed to remain valid for the lifetime of the `HashMap`.

    struct ContentTypeTraits {
        using Key = StringView;
        struct Item {
            StringView extension;
            StringView mimeType;
            PLY_INLINE Item(StringView extension) : extension{extension} {
            }
        };
        PLY_INLINE static bool match(const Item& item, Key key) {
            return item.extension == key;
        }
    };

## Constructing New Items

If declared in the traits class, `HashMap` will use the following static member function to construct `Item` objects:

<% member static void [strong construct](Item*, const Key&) %>

Constructs an uninitialized `Item` from the given `Key`. Must ensure that the `Item` will be converted back to the given `Key` on subsequent lookups.

<% endMembers %>

Otherwise, if `Item` exposes a constructor that accepts `const Key&`, that constructor is used to construct `Item` objects.

Otherwise, the default `Item` constructor is used. In this case, `HashMap::insertOrFind()` callers are responsible for initializing new `Item` object to a valid state.

## Key Hashing

If declared in the traits class, `HashMap` will use the following static member function to hash `Key` objects:

<% member static u32 [strong hash](const Key&) %>

Compute a 32-bit hash value for the key.

<% endMembers %>

Otherwise, `HashMap` will use a `Hasher` object to hash the key. `Hasher` provides built-in support for the following types. You can extend `Hasher` to support additional types by overloading `operator<<()`.

* `u32`
* `u64`
* `float`
* Pointer to class type or `void*`. By default, the pointer value itself is hashed; the object pointed to is not examined in any way.
* `StringView`, `String` and `HybridString`. In particular, note that `char*` will be implicitly converted to `StringView`.

## Using Contexts

The traits class can declare an additional `Context` member type, then accept this type as the third argument to `match`:

<% member typename [strong Context] %>

Provides additional context for `Item`-to-`Key` conversions.

<% member static bool [strong match](const Item&, const Key&, const Context&) %>

Returns `true` if, for the purposes of this hash map, the `Item` object matches the given `Key` in the given `Context`.

<% endMembers %>

If both members are declared, the second argument to `HashMap::find()` and `HashMap::insertOrFind()` will be passed as the third argument to `match()`. Callers are reponsible for passing valid `Context` objects to those functions.

The `Context` object is intended to be a container type such as an `Array`, `FixedArray`, `std::vector` or `Pool`. In this case, `Item` can be declared as `u32` and interpreted as the index into the other container.

Here's an example of a traits class, from Plywood's JSON parser, that implements the `Context` member type:

    struct IndexTraits {
        using Key = StringView;
        using Item = u32;
        using Context = Array<Object::Item>;
        static PLY_INLINE StringView comparand(u32 item, const Array<Object::Item>& ctx) {
            return ctx[item].key.view();
        }
    };
