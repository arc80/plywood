Plywood is a cross-platform open source C++ framework. It was originally developed to support a game engine, but you can use it to build other kinds of software, too. For example, the website you're visiting right now runs on Plywood.

Plywood is released under the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) and supports Windows, Linux and macOS.

Plywood consists of three main components:

1. A **workspace** designed to help you reuse code between applications.
2. A set of **built-in modules** providing cross-platform I/O, containers, process creation and more.
3. A runtime **reflection** and serialization system.

To get started using Plywood, follow the instructions on the [Quick Start](QuickStart) page, then try running the [Hello World](HelloWorld) sample.

This documentation is still a work in progress. Some of Plywood's built-in modules have been documented and some have not. For now, you can browse what's available using the table of contents on the left.
