`InPipe` is a class for reading input from an arbitrary data source such as a file, network socket,
or encryption/compression codec. It's often used as the underlying input source of an `InStream`.

`InPipe` is a lower-level class than `InStream` and is more akin to a Unix file descriptor. When the
`InPipe` reads from a file or network socket, each call to `readSome()` or `read()` invokes a system
call to the OS kernel. Therefore, when reading directly from an `InPipe`, it's best to read
medium-to-large quantities of data (say, several KB) at a time in order to minimize system call
overhead.

If reading small amounts of data (say, a few bytes) at a time -- for example, to parse text or
binary formats -- it's better to work with `InStream` instead.
