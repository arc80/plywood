/*!
`OutStream` performs buffered output to an arbitrary output destination. The output can be sent to
an `OutPipe` or to memory.

`OutStream` is similar to `FILE` in C or `std::ostream` in C++. It maintains an internal output
buffer on the heap, and provides functions to quickly write small amounts of data incrementally,
making it suitable for application-level serialization of text and binary formats. `OutPipe`, on the
other hand, is a lower-level class more akin to a Unix file descriptor.

Every `OutStream` is also a `StringWriter`, and you can cast an `OutStream` to a `StringWriter` at
any time by calling `strWriter()`. The main reason why `OutStream` and `StringWriter` are separate
classes is to help express intention in the code. `OutStream` is mainly intended to write binary
data and `StringWriter` is mainly intended to write text, but the two classes are interchangeable.
